## Tracking User Enggement (Practice Project)

Objective: To analyze whether the new additions to a platform (new courses, exams, and career tracks) have increased student engagement.

The first half of 2022 was expected to be profitable for the company. The reason was the hypothesized increased student engagement after the release of several new features on the company’s website at end-2021. These included enrolling in career tracks and testing knowledge through practice, course, and career track exams. Also expanding the course library to increase user engagement and the platform’s audience as more topics were covered. By comparing different metrics, the effectiveness of these new features can be measured and the overall engagement of the users.
